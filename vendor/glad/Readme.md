I had to manually add loading pointer to *glOrtho* into OpenGL ES 1.0 project.

OpenGL ES 1.0 specification provides *glOrthox* and *glOrthof* in its headers, 
but no glOrtho, and OpenGL 1.3 provides glOrtho, but no glOrthox and glOrthof.
  
Because I wanted to use only common OpenGL functions, with no conditional, per-platform branching,
small change in autogenerated headers seemed to be the lesser evil.
